# Airline-x-FUI-data-visualization

**FUI data** is collected from several sources throughout an airline's operations.

For example, flight schedules are posted directly from airlines onto digital signs around airports. Additionally, baggage tags contain passenger counts from previous flights as well as from new flights that have just arrived at the airport.


**PASSENGER DOZES:** From these sources, airlines calculate how many people have traveled on each airline in the past 24 hours, 60 days, 120 days, and so on.
